# 🧬 Tula - Your Personal Health AI Agent

**Tula** is an open-source collection of [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) skills, configurations, and patterns designed to transform a general-purpose AI agent into a personal health intelligence assistant.

Named after a brilliant, strong woman - a Mensa member and mother of five - Tula embodies sharp intelligence, warmth, and directness in service of one goal: **helping individuals take an active, informed role in their health.**

Tula is also designed to be deployed anywhere. It is open source, self-hosted, model-agnostic, and accessible through Telegram, which operates on low-bandwidth connections and basic smartphones worldwide. A community health center in rural Rwanda, a patient advocacy group in Brazil, or an individual managing a chronic condition in India can deploy the same platform used in a US academic medical center. Health equity requires not just better tools, but tools that are free, private, and available to everyone.

## Why This Matters

Tula exists because health is not abstract. Behind every biomarker is a person. Behind every caregiver is someone they love.

The people building this project are not doing so as a technical exercise. One of us is building Tula because he lost a parent to cancer and carries hereditary risk factors he is determined to monitor proactively. Another is building it because his wife is undergoing cancer treatment, and the demands of caregiving alongside daily life require better tools for tracking medications, understanding test results, and staying organized across multiple providers. Both need the same thing: an AI that consolidates health data, provides context, and highlights what matters, without selling it, sharing it, or placing it behind a subscription.

That is the core insight. The architecture that supports a healthy individual in tracking wellness metrics is the same architecture that supports a patient in managing treatment adherence, or a caregiver in coordinating complex care. It is not three different products. It is one platform that adapts to the user's needs.

Whether you are here to support long-term health, manage a condition, or help someone you love navigate a difficult diagnosis, Tula is designed to serve your needs.

Caregivers deserve dedicated support. Medication adherence, appointment coordination, treatment journaling, and caregiver wellbeing tracking are primary use cases for Tula, not secondary features.

## What Is This?

Tula is **not** a standalone application. It is a health-focused skill layer built on top of OpenClaw, providing the following capabilities:

- 📧 **Intelligent Email Ingestion** - Forward any health-related correspondence to Tula for automatic classification and routing. Tula identifies the content type (laboratory results, imaging studies, explanation of benefits, appointment confirmations, prescription notifications, provider messages) and routes each item to the appropriate skill for processing and structured storage. Email security is enforced at the Exchange transport layer with sender and recipient allowlists. See the [security model](docs/security-model.md).
- 📸 **Universal Photo Capture** - Photograph any health document with your phone and email it to Tula. Printed lab reports, patient portal screens, prescription bottles, hospital whiteboards, insurance EOBs, discharge instructions, imaging reports. If you can see it, you can photograph it, and Tula can extract structured data from it using multimodal AI. No patient portal integration required. No FHIR API. No IT department involvement. Your phone camera becomes the universal health data connector.
- 🧪 **Laboratory Result Parsing** - Automated extraction of biomarker values, units, and reference ranges from laboratory report PDFs using purpose-built medical text models (MedGemma) or general-purpose reasoning models (Claude). Longitudinal trend tracking with out-of-range flagging.
- 🩻 **Medical Image Interpretation** - Support for DICOM imaging studies including MRI, CT, radiograph, mammography, and ultrasound. Powered by purpose-built healthcare imaging models (Google MedGemma multimodal or Microsoft MedImageInsight/CXRReportGen, depending on deployment context). Provides plain-language annotation of key findings, medical terminology translation, and longitudinal comparison across sequential studies.
- 🧬 **Genomic Health Reports** - Import and analysis of consumer genomic data (e.g., 23andMe) to identify clinically relevant genetic variants and correlate predispositions with current biomarker profiles and care protocols.
- 🏥 **Electronic Health Record Integration** - Retrieval of medical history, visit summaries, and provider documentation from patient portals via FHIR R4 and patient access APIs.
- ⌚ **Wearable Device Integration** - Synchronization of daily physiological metrics from compatible wearable devices (e.g., Garmin), including heart rate variability (HRV), resting heart rate, sleep architecture, and stress indicators.
- 🩺 **Home Health Device Integration** - Connectivity with Bluetooth and Wi-Fi enabled home monitoring devices including blood pressure monitors, body composition scales, pulse oximeters, and glucose meters for continuous, passive data collection.
- 📓 **Patient Health Journal** - Structured daily check-ins via Telegram for tracking sleep quality, energy levels, mood, symptom burden, and treatment protocol adherence.
- 💼 **Professional Journal** - Business-focused note capture with automated daily summaries, weekly synthesis, and searchable history.
- 🔬 **Research Synthesis** - Scheduled retrieval and summarization of current peer-reviewed literature and clinical evidence relevant to the user's health profile and active protocols.
- 🗣️ **Voice Input** - Speech-to-text transcription of Telegram voice messages. Medical voice input uses MedASR (5x more accurate than general-purpose transcription on clinical terminology). General voice uses Whisper or Azure Speech Services.
- 🔒 **De-Identification** - Removal of protected health information (PHI) from health documents prior to sharing, export, or use in research contexts. Designed to support HIPAA Safe Harbor de-identification principles.
- 🧠 **Intelligent Model Routing** - Each task is directed to the most capable, cost-effective, and privacy-appropriate model available. Purpose-built healthcare models handle medical imaging and text extraction. General-purpose reasoning models handle clinical synthesis and trend analysis. Lightweight models handle routine interactions. See the [model routing reference](docs/model-routing.md) for details.

## Who Tula Is For

Tula supports patients navigating complex illness, caregivers, individuals managing chronic conditions, those with hereditary risk factors, community health programs in low-resource settings, and anyone focused on preventive health and wellness. See the [detailed use cases](docs/use-cases.md) for more information.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- An [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) instance (see our [Deployment Guide](docs/deployment-guide.md))
- An Azure VM (B2s is sufficient, approximately $30/month) or any server running Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
- API keys for [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com) (Claude) and [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com) (Gemini)
- A Telegram account

### Quick Start

1. **Deploy OpenClaw** - Follow the [step-by-step deployment guide](docs/deployment-guide.md). The guide covers the complete process from Azure VM creation to Telegram integration. It is written to be accessible to administrators without prior Linux experience.

2. **Configure Email Ingestion** - The [email router design](docs/email-router-design.md) and [setup guide](docs/email-router-setup-guide.md) lay out the architecture and M365 / Entra ID / transport-rule steps. The [build plan](docs/email-router-build-plan.md) sequences the actual implementation work and replaces the himalaya client with Microsoft Graph API for cleaner OAuth and tighter integration with the existing Node-based skill scripts.

3. **Browse Your Health Data** - The [dashboard build plan](docs/dashboard-build-plan.md) describes a Node web app served from the VM that renders a beautiful, modern, mobile-friendly view of all email-ingested FHIR data — activity feed, lab trends, imaging reports, medications, appointments, with live updates as new emails are processed. Designed to be reachable privately via Tailscale; no public exposure of health data.

3. **Install Tula Skills** - Skills live under [`skills/`](skills/). Copy the ones you want into `~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/` on your OpenClaw host. See the [skills development guide](docs/skills-development.md) for details, conventions, and the testing workflow with Microsoft Waza.

4. **Configure Data Sources** - Connect wearable and home health devices and configure check-in schedules.

## Tula and Aria

Tula is maintained by RealActivity as an open-source project under the MIT license. RealActivity also develops **Aria**, a commercial hospital-scale platform built on the same Tula skills. The two are distinct products with distinct licenses:

- **Tula** is the public, MIT-licensed health agent skill collection and single-user reference deployment. It runs end-to-end on a single VM and is complete on its own.
- **Aria** is RealActivity's private, commercial multi-tenant platform for hospitals and health systems. It consumes Tula skills as a versioned dependency and adds the patient identity, ingest router, dashboard, LLM gateway, audit, and compliance plumbing required at hospital scale.

Contributions to Tula skills benefit both projects. The scope of what's maintained in this repo vs. what lives in Aria is documented in [`OPEN_CORE.md`](OPEN_CORE.md).

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Tula is built as a set of standard OpenClaw skills. Contributors familiar with OpenClaw can begin contributing immediately.

**Ways to contribute:**

- **Report issues** - If something does not work as expected, open an issue. Detailed bug reports are among the most valuable contributions at this stage.
- **Propose a health skill** - We are tracking community ideas in [Discussions](../../discussions).
- **Build a skill** - Read the [skills development guide](docs/skills-development.md) and use the [`med-pdf`](skills/med-pdf/) skill as the reference template. The [skills authoring conventions](skills/AGENTS.md) explain the OpenClaw-first / Waza-second priority rule. Submit a pull request.
- **Improve documentation** - The deployment guide was written during a real setup session. If any section is unclear or outdated, improvements are appreciated.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed guidelines. See the [community skill ideas](docs/community-skills.md) for a full list of skills we would like to build.

## Principles

- **Patient empowerment through health literacy.** Tula translates clinical information into language that supports informed decision-making.
- **Data sovereignty.** All data is stored locally on the user's own server. No cloud health platforms. No third-party data sharing.
- **Intelligent model routing.** Each task is directed to the most capable model for that specific job. Purpose-built healthcare models for medical imaging and text. General-purpose reasoning models for clinical synthesis. The right model for the right task in the right deployment context.
- **Caregiver recognition.** Caregiver support is a core use case, not a secondary consideration.
- **Global health equity.** Open source, self-hosted, model-agnostic, and accessible on low-bandwidth networks. Designed so that a clinic in a low-resource setting has access to the same tools as a patient in a high-income country.
- **Defense in depth.** Email ingestion is locked to authorized senders at the Exchange transport layer. Outbound email is restricted to authorized recipients. Prompt injection risks are analyzed honestly and mitigated at multiple layers. See the [security model](docs/security-model.md).

See the [full principles](docs/principles.md) for our complete set of values and commitments.

## Cost

Running Tula costs approximately **$35 - $115/month** depending on usage, from text-based journaling and laboratory parsing at the low end to medical image interpretation and genomic analysis at the high end. No subscription fees. No platform lock-in. Users provide their own API keys. See the [cost guide](docs/cost-guide.md) for a detailed breakdown.

## Background

This project originated as a personal build by a Windows Server administrator of 25 years deploying his first native Linux server to run an AI health agent. The [deployment guide](docs/deployment-guide.md) was written in real time as issues were encountered and resolved. It documents the actual experience, including common errors and their solutions.

Tula is a [RealActivity](https://realactivity.ai) initiative.
